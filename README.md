Nxtjob.ai 
The NxtJob.ai Resume Builder Optimization project involved addressing high abandonment rates during the onboarding process. Traffic was driven primarily by Google Ads, but many users were not completing the sign-up. The project focused on enhancing mobile accessibility, improving site design, integrating LinkedIn for streamlined onboarding, and implementing a progress meter to retain user attention. Additional strategies included offering multi-format document support and introducing AI-guided onboarding. These efforts aimed to improve user engagement, lower drop-off rates, and maximize the return on ad spend.
